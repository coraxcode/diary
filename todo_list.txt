Future Improvements

1 -    Replace SHA-256 with SHA-512 throughout the entire program.

2 -    Compress a single TXT file using ZSTD, with SHA-512 verification (parameter: compress).

3 -    Compress the "Diary" directory into a TAR archive, applying ZSTD compression and SHA-512 verification (parameter: compress).

4 -    Implement decompression functionality for files or directories, with the program verifying SHA-512 before extracting (parameter: decompress).
